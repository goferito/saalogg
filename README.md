*Just a simple looging tool*

### What this is about
I just wanted to play a bit with the console object, and overwrite it
to log a timestamp with different colours regarding the function used.
So, if loaded, `console.log` will print a blue timestamp at the beginning of
each line. `console.warn` will print an orange one and `console.log` a red
one.
